# Classy

 Classy provides Hobart and William Smith Colleges (HWS) students a space to **anonymously** share reviews, recommendations and rank courses offered at the Colleges.

Student-sourced feedback on class and professor experiences, that are not available (or publicized) through existing applications, helps other students make more informed decisions when choosing classes.
